The original Penumbra can be found at: https://github.com/ztellman/penumbra

From the original readme:

"Penumbra is an idiomatic wrapper for OpenGL in Clojure, by way of LWJGL."

This version of Penumbra is a fork that is under somewhat more active development. However, the purpose of this version of Penumbra is primarily to support brevis (https://github.com/kephale/brevis).

The only examples that are functional are:

- test/example/opengl/gears.clj
